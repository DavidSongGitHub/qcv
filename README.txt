# Description

QCV is a Qt-based computer vision framework library that provides an easy to use interface to display, analyze and run computer vision algorithms. The library is provided with practical examples to show what you can do with just a few lines of code. OpenCV is used as the supporting computer vision library.

QCV provides interfaces for C and C++. The C interface is a set of simple function calls to allow the user to visualize data and obtain events from the system and user input. 

The C++ interface has more features allowing the user to run and analyze complex computer vision algorithm in a few lines of code (see the stereo and surf examples).

QCV offers a 2D visualization tool, an on-line on-the-fly parameter editor, a clock tool to evaluate computation times, and a control tool to manipulate input video and sequences of images.

Multiple application examples that demonstrate the main features of this framework are provided in the last
